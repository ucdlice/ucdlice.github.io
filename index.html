<p>Human-borne parasites captivate our attention due to their intimate connection with our own evolutionary history, their complex life cycles, and their practical influence on public planning and personal hygiene. Head and body lice, in particular, have garnered scrutiny within and outside the scientific community because of their somewhat ephemeral appearance on human hosts. Head lice (<em>Pediculus humanus capitus</em>) diverged from their ancestor with chimpanzee lice 5-7 million years ago (Reed et al., 2004), while body lice (<em>Pediculus humanus humanus</em>), have a less clear evolutionary history. They appear to have arisen independently multiple times from head lice following the advent of clothing ~100,000 years ago (Li et al., 2010; Light et al., 2008; Kittler et al., 2003), and often emerge when humans live in close contact and in populations who infrequently change clothing.</p>

<p><strong><em>We are interested in this transition from head to body lice, whether the two are reproductively isolated species, and how genetic variation is distributed in local head lice populations.</em></strong></p>

<p>The species status of head and body lice has been debated for nearly 100 years (Nuttall, 1917), with recent publications arguing body lice are a subspecies or ecomorph of head lice based on low nucleotide divergence between head and body lice (0.1-1.3% in coding regions; Olds et al., 2012). This conflicts with historical evidence that head and body lice do not interbreed in nature, and that when crossed in the lab hybrids are occasionally intersex or hermaphroditic, suggesting some degree of reproductive isolation (Dobzhansky, 1937). When raised on the body, head lice adopt the morphological characteristics of body lice (size, development, and location of oviposition) within three generations (Mayr, 1942; Levene and Dobzhansky, 1959; Busvine, 1948).</p>

<p>Body lice are on average larger than head lice, spend most of their time in clothing out of contact with human skin, and are capable of transmitting bacterial diseases like typhus and trench fever (Fournier et al., 2002). Head lice, while a nuisance, are not vectors of disease, and feed continuously on the scalp. Human blood is rich in a variety of nutrients, but is deficient in vitamin B5. To feed exclusively on blood, lice have evolved an obligate association with a vertically transmitted endosymbiotic bacterium that produces B vitamins, <em>Candidatus</em> Riesia <em>pediculicola</em>. These bacteria are housed in four specialized mycetome organs of the louse, and migrate between mycetomes through the hemolymph, generating an immune response in the louse (Perotti et al., 2007). This immune response is stronger in head lice than body lice, and these differences may account for the ability of body lice to transmit bacterial diseases that infect humans (Perotti et al., 2007). We are interested in genetic changes between head and body lice that may be involved in endosymbiont load and disease transmission.</p>
